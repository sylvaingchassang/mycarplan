    Are electric vehicles really more environmentally friendly?
  </h4>
  <p class="text-gray-800">
    Overall, yes, especially in France: because French electricity has a very low carbon intensity.
    It's currently less clear for an electric car driven elsewhere in Europe or the United States,
    where the electricity mix is more carbon-intensive but the growth of renewables is changing this fast.<br>
    Even taking into account the manufacturing of the battery, an electric car driven in France
    will emit about half the COâ‚‚ emissions of an equivalent combustion car over its lifecycle.<br>
    The recycling or reuse of batteries is still little tested, but 
    their value is high and it seems likely that they will be recycled or 
    at least reused in stationary applications.<br>

    Should I buy a plug-in hybrid vehicle?
  </h4>
  <p class="text-gray-800">
It depends on how you use it. If you charge the battery 
regularly, the answer is yes, even if the range is limited. Plug-in 
hybrid vehicles have a bad reputation because 
in the past, due to very strong government incentives, they 
were purchased by opportunistic users who had no
intention of charging them regularly. In this case, the 
extra weight of the batteries makes these vehicles even more polluting than an 
equivalent combustion vehicle. This justifies discontinuing 
government incentives for plug-in hybrid vehicles, 
but not rejecting them outright. They are a good solution when they 
are charged regularly.

    I can't find an electric vehicle at a reasonable price, what should I do?
  </h4>
  <p class="text-gray-800">
If you need to buy a vehicle but can't find an 
electric vehicle at a reasonable price, you have several options to 
have a positive impact on the climate. If you have a choice, a used 
car is probably preferable to a new car. The type of 
vehicle depends on your usage. If you drive little, you are the best 
possible owner for a polluting vehicle. If you drive a lot,
buy the least polluting vehicle possible that suits your needs. If 
you buy new, you can reduce your emissions by buying a 
relatively small vehicle, or a hybrid vehicle.

  <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">
    Is the battery of a used vehicle reliable?
  </h4>
  <p class="text-gray-800">
Overall, yes. Available data suggests that batteries 
lose less than 2% of their capacity per year. This means that a 5-year-old 
used car will have lost about 10% of its range.
