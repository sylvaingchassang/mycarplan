  </div>

My Car Plan is a plan to reduce automobile emissions, based on 
research conducted by the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cae-eco.
fr">French Council of Economic Analysis</a> with the help of <a 
target="_blank" 
rel="noopener noreferrer" 
href="https://www.quechoisir.org/"> UFC Que 
Choisir</a> and <a  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
href="https://flash.bpifrance.fr"> BPI France</a>.<br><br>

<b>The objective:</b> reduce emissions from individual transport by 15% in 5 years, 
at a manageable cost for households, manufacturers, 
and public finances. <br><br>

<b>How?</b> A pragmatic plan in three steps: [Keep](#i-keep), [Cut](#i-reduce)
, [Commit](#i-commit).

  </div>


<p>If you drive little (in Europe, say less than 8,000 km per year), you are 
the ideal owner of a used combustion vehicle.</p> <br>

<p><b>What does this mean?</b> If you drive less than 8,000 km per 
year, you would likely reduce CO2 emissions more by keeping your 
used combustion vehicle than by buying an electric vehicle.</p><br> 

<p><b>Why?</b> Unless you scrap your combustion vehicle, 
it will be bought by a household 
that drives significantly more than 8,000 km per year on average. 
</p><br>

  <p><b>Do you own a combustion vehicle and are considering buying an electric 
vehicle?</b> The best strategy is to keep your combustion 
vehicle, but use it very little, for example for weekend shopping 
or long vacation trips. Buy a small electric 
vehicle with a modest-sized battery for your daily trips.</p><br>


  <p><b>Do you drive a lot?</b> If you drive more than 15,000 km per year, 
consider a hybrid or electric vehicle, new or used.</p><br> 


<p><b>A practical rule:</b> if possible, favor used or 
electric vehicles over buying a new combustion vehicle, which will emit COâ‚‚ for many years.</p>

<!-- I Reduce -->

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">2. Cut</h2>
  </div>

  <p>Don't feel guilty about using a used combustion vehicle. Instead, reduce your fuel consumption by 10%, starting today.</p>

  <p><b>Why?</b> By 2050, an immediate 10% reduction in vehicle use across 
the entire fleet has a comparable effect, in terms of GHG emissions and 
warming, to an accelerated electrification of new vehicle sales.</p>

  <p>Two reasons for this: (1) the car fleet renews slowly; (2) the sooner we act, the more we limit temperature rise.</p>

  <p><strong>How to do it?</strong> Essentially by being thrifty.</p>
  
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
    <li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-efficient_driving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fuel-efficient driving</a> to consume less gas without changing your trips by: driving smoothly, driving at the speed limit on highways, and regularly checking your tire pressure.</li>
    <li>Switch to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage-based_insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usage-based insurance</a> to pay more attention to your usage over time and be rewarded for your efforts.</li>
    <li>Give up 1 trip out of 10, by grouping your travels or by using public transport, cycling or walking, once a week.</li>

<!-- I Commit -->


  <div class="flex-1 bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-6 border-b-4 
border-mpa-teal" id="i-commit">
   <div class="flex items-center mb-4">

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold">3. Commit</h2>
  </div>

<p>For the EV transition to be successful, many economic 
actors (car manufacturers,  infrastructure operators, local governments...) must coordinate significant 
investments.</p><br>

<p>If the demand for electric vehicles is low in the short term, these 
actors risk panicking and not investing, unless the government offers 
subsidies that have become  very costly for public finances.</p><br> 

<p>To avoid this,  we need to provide a strong signal 
of 
future demand!</p><br>

<p>According to your possibilities, we ask you to make up to three 
personal commitments known via the form below.</p><br>

<b>Commitment 1: My next vehicle will be electric.
</b><br>
Your commitment allows transition actors to better plan their 
investments. In return, you will be given priority access to a
subsidized purchase plan that we are setting up with our partners, 
to help you better buy your next vehicle.
<br><br>

<b>Commitment 2: I sign up and participate in the My Car Plan community.</b> 
<br>
You agree to receive emails from us that may 
invite you to participate in research surveys, offer you 
discount coupons 
from our partners, or simply keep you informed. Maintaining 
contact with you will  allow us to better understand your needs, 
as well as the measures that work or don't work.
<br><br>

<b>Commitment 3: I share the My Car Plan site with my contacts.</b> <br>
For My Car Plan to have an impact, we need to interest as many people 
as possible. Without this, we will not be able to convince private and 
public actors of the merits of our pragmatic yet ambitious approach. 
If you agree, we will send you a link to share with those of 
your contacts who might be interested, and to initiate a conversation.
<br><br>

<b>Ready to Make an Impact?</b>
Take a moment to fill out our short form below and share your commitments 
with us.
